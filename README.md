# Bell's Palsy Clinical Trial Analysis - Statistical Learning in Epidemiology

## Overview

This project explores the application of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to study the epidemiology and treatment effectiveness in Bell’s Palsy. Using a **synthetic dataset** modeled after a real clinical trial, we aim to discover patterns and predictive factors that can enhance our understanding of patient outcomes and inform healthcare decisions.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Bell's Palsy Clinical Trial](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bells-palsy-clinical-trial)
- **License**: CC0-1.0
- **Note**: Although the dataset is **not real patient data**, it is a **synthetic representation** of a genuine clinical trial, preserving the structure, variables, and statistical properties of the original study. This makes it suitable for academic and exploratory purposes while ensuring privacy and compliance.

> **Study Design**: Based on a real double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, factorial trial.

## Objectives

- Analyze the impact of treatment types on recovery from Bell’s Palsy.
- Explore demographic and clinical variables associated with different outcomes.
- Use machine learning models to predict recovery or progression.
- Interpret model outputs to support potential epidemiological insights.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing value treatment
   - Categorical encoding
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Univariate and bivariate visualizations
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Treatment group comparisons

3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic regression
   - Decision trees and random forests
   - Support Vector Machines and others

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - ROC curves and AUC
